## Use an SDK

Okta recommends using an Identity Engine SDK with the Sign-In Widget to implement your embedded authentication Interaction Code flow. See [Okta Identity Engine SDKs & Samples](/code/oie/) for a list of Identity Engine SDKs that you can download to start using with your app.

> **Note:** Even if you are not using the Sign-In Widget in your final embedded app, the Sign-In Widget can be used to validate and test your defined policies before investing a lot of time on coding the authentication flow.

For instructions on how to install and use Okta Identity Engine SDKs, refer to [Download and set up the SDK, Sign-In Widget, and sample app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/). You can download Okta sample apps to see how the SDKs are used in your app's framework. See [Examples](#examples) for a list of sample apps.
